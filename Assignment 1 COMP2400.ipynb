This assessment is designed to familiarize you with the process of training a facial recognition model, implementing it using a Python program; and critically examine the impact of facial recognition systems on society. This assignment will be marked out of 100, and will count towards **25%** of the total unit assessment."

    "## Olivetti Faces Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Olivetti Faces dataset is a popular dataset for testing and evaluating face recognition algorithms. It was created by AT&T Laboratories Cambridge and contains a set of grayscale images of faces, captured under different lighting conditions, facial expressions, and poses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains a total of **400 images**, each of size **64 x 64 pixels**. There are 10 different images for each of 40 distinct individuals, with each individual photographed in different sessions. The images were taken with a Canon camera, under controlled conditions that included a uniform background and controlled lighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Olivetti Faces dataset is often used for tasks such as face recognition, face detection, and facial expression analysis. The dataset is popular because it is relatively small, making it easy to work with, and because it contains images that capture a wide range of facial variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is available in the scikit-learn Python library, which makes it easy to load and use for machine learning tasks. In scikit-learn, the Olivetti Faces dataset is provided as a dictionary with two keys: data and images. The data key contains a 2D array of the flattened image data, while the images key contains a 3D array of the original image data.\n"
